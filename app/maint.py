"""Maintenance (CMMS) module — in-house replacement for Opmaint, inside the QMS app.

Covers: an asset register, per-asset checklists (each checkpoint tagged with a
category — Hydraulic / Mechanical / Electrical), preventive-maintenance schedules
triggered by date interval AND/OR running-hours, category→staff assignment
(reusing the employees login, with Electrical varying by location), completion
logging (machine history), and WhatsApp reminders (due-today to the assignee,
overdue escalation to a supervisor) via WATI.

All tables are Neon and self-create on first use.
